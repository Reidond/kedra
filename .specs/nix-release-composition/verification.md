# D2 verification

Source is adopted on `codex/nix-release-composition` above D1
`712927eb0180610fd1ea3e29cccd5fdc6ac16f2b`. The twenty-path preparation was
hash/mode reconciled before adoption; later-layer modules remain inactive.
Explicit local fixture support is active implementation. No runtime production
signing/main override is introduced.

Pass: adopted Python Ruff/Bash syntax/diff checks; standard public
release-material workflows for both targets, including no-change/rank/content/
scope/architecture refusals; release-interop public trust, history and sixteen
OpenSSL signature/artifact/installer workflows. Exact local fixtures:
`target/nix-delivery/d2-release-{material,interop}`.

Pass on the adopted D2 checkout above712927e: pinned Rust1.98.1 workspace
formatting, Clippy with warnings denied, ordinary CLI E2E (11 passed, six
Docker-dependent cases explicitly ignored) and workspace release build. No Rust
source was edited during those gates. Ignored cases supply no runtime coverage.

Source review caught root-owned failed installer scratch cleanup; correction
captures/rechecks its owned root, refuses all kernel mountpoints beneath it,
uses fixed narrow privileged removal and preserves failure/reporting semantics.
Actual cleanup/mount/sentinel refusal is not-run.

## Controller inputs

and Docker image `3f3c01aaaebf7cce837356b688b7c059a4749f10bd7660dec7c58fc454a283f0`.

Pinned [uv0.12.19 release](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/tag/0.12.19)
provides the ARM GNU archive/checksum. Direct release URL returns403; official
GitHub release asset587158851 is downloaded through authenticated API and matches
SHA256 `0804e9b164c64b6914182d5920c08551958a095986f10a3731056df701126436`.
Only bounded regular ARM ELF uv/uvx files are extracted under private
`target/nix-delivery/d2-runtime-inputs`; no workstation tool installation.
Its receipt retains exact origin/hash/size. New controller execution/ABI remains
not-run; library version comparisons confer no pass.

## Remaining gates

Not-run: fresh normal ARM foundation/composition/native transfer; normal
generated-authority encrypted Anaconda install; ISO-free boot; public forward
update/rollback with persistent home/data and refusals; disabled Secure Boot
installer refusal; actual cleanup/resource evidence and new source CI.
Protected-main production signing/publication/no-change repetition remain
separate from disposable fixture qualification.

Earlier whole-payload workflows on8a8796c are still running; they are not
borrowed as D2/new-source results.
